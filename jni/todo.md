# TODO
* Split properly into files

* Clean up docs

* Check JniGlobalRef actually works

* Isolates example with sendPort receivePort.

* NativeFinalizer instead of delete & use

## Bugs
* double typedef generated by ffigen (JniEnv, JniEnv1), don't know why. It's harmless but confusing to the user.

* Typedef's should be exposed properly;
	-> Eg: JObject should be seen as JObject, not Pointer<Void>
	-> Currently it's a typedef, which makes it exposed as bare type to consumer library ?

* Inspect NDK / gradle warning on Android release build
