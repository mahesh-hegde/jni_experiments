# TODO

* test & benchmark application
	* jarFileTests // use some popular jar ?
	* androidPlatformTests ?
	* One small useful android application (Packages list?)

* Clean up docs

* Isolates with sendPort receivePort. Make JniGlobalRef sendable.

* convert strings in JniObject methods' arguments.

* Documentation & check style

* Clean up docs

* UTF16 string type with length (?)
	- Are there differences between java and dart utf16?

* NativeFinalizer instead of delete ?

## Bugs
* double typedef generated by ffigen (JniEnv, JniEnv1), don't know why. It's harmless but confusing to the user.

* Typedef's should be exposed properly;
	-> Eg: JObject should be seen as JObject, not Pointer<Void>
	-> Currently it's a typedef, which makes it exposed as bare type to consumer library ?

* Inspect NDK / gradle warning on Android release build
