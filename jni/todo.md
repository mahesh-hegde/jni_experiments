# TODO

* UTF16 string type with length

* Test & benchmark application

* Load DLL from surroundings if not loaded

## Bugs
* double typedef generated by ffigen (JniEnv, JniEnv1), don't know why. It's harmless but confusing to the user.

* Typedef's should be exposed properly;
	-> Eg: JObject should be seen as JObject, not Pointer<Void>
	-> Currently it's a typedef, which makes it exposed as bare type to consumer library ?

## Next
* Utility functions
class JniUtil
	* getJNIEnv, getJavaVM, getApplicationContext, getClassLoader
	* findClass, findMethod, jvalueArray
	* invokeObject, invokeString, invoke -> JValue
	* invokeOn(cls, mId, args);
	* deleteAll(localReferences: []);
	* exceptionDescribe()

	* StringCache(params)
