# TODO

	* androidPlatformTests

* Bundling with dart standalone application

* Clean up docs

* callStringMethod, callStaticStringMethod

* Documentation & check style

* Clean up docs

* UTF16 string type with length (?)

* NativeFinalizer instead of delete ?

## Bugs
* double typedef generated by ffigen (JniEnv, JniEnv1), don't know why. It's harmless but confusing to the user.

* Typedef's should be exposed properly;
	-> Eg: JObject should be seen as JObject, not Pointer<Void>
	-> Currently it's a typedef, which makes it exposed as bare type to consumer library ?

* Inspect NDK / gradle warning on Android release build
