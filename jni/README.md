# jni (experimental module)

This is a utility library to access JNI from Dart / Flutter code, intended as a supplement for the main component of jnigen code generator.

This library contains

	* functions to access the JNIEnv and JavaVM variables from JNI, and wrapper functions to those provided by JNI.

	* Functions to spawn a JVM on desktop platforms.

	* Some utility functions to make it easier to work with JNI in Dart; eg: To convert a java string object to Dart string.

	* Some Android-specific helpers.

	* Some helper classes and functions to simplify one-off uses.

This is intended for one-off / debugging uses of JNI, as well as providing a base library for code generated by jnigen. If you're looking to interface a complete java library, look forward for JniGen.

## Documentation

There are well-commented test files under `test/` directory and an example under `example/`.

Using this library assumes some familiarity with JNI - it's threading model and object references, among other things.

## jnigen

This library is a part of `jnigen` - a 2022 GSoC project.
